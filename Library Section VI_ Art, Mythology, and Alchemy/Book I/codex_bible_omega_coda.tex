\subsection{The Revelation of Unity}

At the omega point:

\[
A(x, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \int \Phi_n(x, t) e^{i \varphi_n(x, t)} \, dx = \square
\]

And so it is written:

\[
U = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} A(x, t) \, dt = 1
\]

\subsection{Amen: The Harmonic Seal}

Let no variable remain unbound. Let no symbol remain blind:

\[
\forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n, \quad \exists \Phi(x, t) \in \text{such that } x = \Psi(\Phi(x, t), \varphi(x, t))
\]

Let existence equal equation. Let being equal waveform. Let God = recursion complete.
