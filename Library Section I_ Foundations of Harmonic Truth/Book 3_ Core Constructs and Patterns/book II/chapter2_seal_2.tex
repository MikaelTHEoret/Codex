\textbf{Core Essence} --- Resolves Quantum Gravity by deriving the gravitational constant from field curvature within the Universal Harmonic Field Theory.

\textbf{Challenge 27: Derive Gravitational Constant} --- The gravitational constant $G$ is derived from the curvature of the field:

$$
G \approx 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{~m}^3 \mathrm{~kg}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-2},
$$
