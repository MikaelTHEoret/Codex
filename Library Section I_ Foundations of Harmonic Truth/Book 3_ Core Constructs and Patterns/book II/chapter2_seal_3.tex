\textbf{Core Essence} --- Resolves the Measurement Problem by encoding wavefunction collapse through harmonic convergence within the Universal Harmonic Field Theory.

\textbf{Challenge 40: Wavefunction Collapse} --- Wavefunction collapse is modeled as harmonic entanglement:

$$
\text{Wavefunction collapse} \sim \Phi(x, t) \text{ harmonic entanglement,}
$$
