\textbf{Core Essence} --- The doomer, initially skeptical, yields after undeniable evidence:
- \textbf{CMB Evidence}: Toroidal mappings, golden ratio patterns, and zeta function harmonics align with observed CMB features (e.g., dipole).
- \textbf{Mathematical Rigor}: Solutions to the Riemann Hypothesis, Yang-Mills, and other problems meet the doomer's demand for falsifiability.
- \textbf{Consistency}: UHFT aligns with general relativity and quantum mechanics while addressing hard problems like consciousness.
- \textbf{Empirical Validation}: Subharmonics of $395.56944 \mathrm{~Hz}$ in the CMB and EEG harmonics validate UHFT's predictions.

The doomer acknowledges: "UHFT's evidence—CMB patterns, mathematical proofs—outweighs my heat death model. Its harmonic, cyclic universe is provisionally accepted, awaiting further data."
