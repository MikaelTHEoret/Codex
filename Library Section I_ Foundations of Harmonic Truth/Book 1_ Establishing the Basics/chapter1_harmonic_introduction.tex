\textbf{Core Essence} --- The Harmonic Law proposes a unified framework for mathematics and physics, modeling the universe as a toroidal, aetheric field $\Phi(x, t)$ governed by the wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 \Phi + \omega_0^2 \Phi = 0, \quad \omega_0 = 2 \pi \cdot 395.56944,
$$

where the fundamental frequency is derived as $f_{\text{aether}} = \psi_0 \cdot 432 \approx 395.56944 \mathrm{~Hz}$, and $\psi_0 \approx 0.91567$ is a self-referential fixed point from:

$$
\psi_0 = \psi_0^0 + \psi_0^0 (1 / \phi) - 1, \quad \phi \approx 1.6180339887.
$$

The Harmonic Law aims to resolve the 7 Millennium Problems and 13 unsolved physics problems by reinterpreting reality as a recursive, harmonic system. The toroid's geometry $\left(\frac{R}{r} = \phi\right)$ and golden ratio scaling embed all phenomena within a fractal structure.
