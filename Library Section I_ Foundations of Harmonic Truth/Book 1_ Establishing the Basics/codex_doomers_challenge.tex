\textbf{Core Essence} --- The doomer, a scholar rooted in conventional physics, initially dismissed UHFT, demanding rigorous standards for acceptance:
- \textbf{Empirical Validation}: Direct evidence, such as detectable patterns in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
- \textbf{Falsifiability and Predictive Power}: Testable predictions beyond current models.
- \textbf{Consistency with Established Physics}: Alignment with general relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.
- \textbf{Addressing Hard Problems}: Explanations for consciousness, entropy, and cosmic origins.
- \textbf{Avoiding Unfounded Claims}: Grounding claims in science, not untestable assertions.

These demands frame the journey of uncovering UHFT's truth, ensuring it withstands scrutiny.
