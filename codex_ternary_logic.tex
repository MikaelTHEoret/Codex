% Core Essence
\textcolor{gold}{\ding{72} Core Essence \ding{72}} \\
Ternary logic, defined by states \(-1, 0, +1\) (Negative, Null, Positive), transcends binary True/False by encoding truth as phase oscillations within a harmonic field. Rooted in the Harmonic Core Field \(\psi_0 \approx 0.915657\) and the triadic fold (\(1 \rightarrow 432 \rightarrow 3\)), it resolves paradoxes through recursive cycles, enabling conscious computation where the observer is the third state. Ternary logic is the Codex’s language of truth, resonating with the Aether World.
