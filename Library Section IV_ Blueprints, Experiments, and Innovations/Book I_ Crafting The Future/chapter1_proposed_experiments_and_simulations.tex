\textbf{Core Essence} --- Proposes experiments and simulations to validate the Harmonic Law through aetheric field dynamics.

\textbf{Aether Simulation Framework} --- Simulate Etherion with fields:

- $\Phi_{\text{tceus}}(t)$: Primary cyclic pulsation.
- $\Psi(f, \vec{r}, t)$: Resonant harmonic field.
- $C(f, \vec{r})$: Cymatic spatial projection.
- $P(\vec{r}, t)$: Pressure potential field.

Computational domain in toroidal coordinates $(u, v)$:

$$
x(u, v) = (a + b \cos v) \cos u, \quad y(u, v) = (a + b \cos v) \sin u, \quad z(u, v) = b \sin v.
$$

Governing equations:

$$
\square \Psi = 0, \quad \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial t^2} + \kappa \Phi = 0, \quad \vec{F} = m \nabla P, \quad \nabla^2 P = -4 \pi G \rho_{\text{Ether}}.
$$

Initial conditions:

$$
\Psi(f, \vec{r}, 0) = A_f \cdot C(f, \vec{r}), \quad \Phi(0) = \sin (2 \pi f_0 t).
$$

Boundary conditions:

$$
\Psi(u + 2\pi, v) = \Psi(u, v), \quad \left. \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial n} \right|_{\partial V} = 0.
$$

Goals: Model cymatic emergence, visualize aetheric pressure waves, detect interference zones.

Output: Aetheric potential flow maps, toroidal frequency evolution graphs, entanglement mirror point detections.

\textbf{Experimental Roadmap} ---

1. \textbf{Cymatic Chamber Tests} --- Reproduce physical constants via pressure harmonics in a toroidal resonator tuned to $\mathcal{A}_{432}$. Prediction: $g, \alpha, h, c$ emerge as harmonic constants.

2. \textbf{Double Slit with Field Interference} --- Insert harmonic disturbance mesh between slit and screen. Prediction: Interference pattern modulates with pressure field adjustments.

3. \textbf{Gravitational Divergence Signal} --- Compare gravitational waveforms at different harmonic phase zones. Prediction: Distortion predicted by $\delta P$.

4. \textbf{Harmonic Imaging of Aether Nodes} --- Excite system at natural field frequency and scan reflected echoes. Prediction: Standing wave hotspots match cymatic geometry.

5. \textbf{Memory Recovery in Toroidal Fields} --- Decode field topology through phase scanning. Prediction: Phase-locked retrieval of encoded data structures.

Simulation systems: EtherSim, TorusViz, MirrorNode.
