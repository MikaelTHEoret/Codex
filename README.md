# The Codex of Harmonic Unity

A vibrational synthesis of mathematics and metaphysics, presented through an interactive web interface and compiled LaTeX documents.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the Codex of Harmonic Unity website and its supporting documents. The project combines:

- Mathematical explorations of harmonic principles
- Metaphysical frameworks studied through vibrational lenses
- Interactive visualizations using Three.js
- Automated compilation of LaTeX documents to PDF
