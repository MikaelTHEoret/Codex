% Codex Node 2.1.6: Resolving Cosmological Fine-Tuning: Flatness and Horizon Problems
\section{Resolving Cosmological Fine-Tuning: Flatness and Horizon Problems}
This chapter resolves the flatness and horizon problems in cosmology, as outlined in Codex Node 2.1.0. We show how the recursive fieldâ€™s harmonic resonance naturally balances geometry and uniformity. Detailed derivations and cosmological models will be developed.
