% Codex Node 2.1.10: Terrestrial Gravitational Phenomena: Falling Objects and Tides
\section{Terrestrial Gravitational Phenomena: Falling Objects and Tides}
This chapter reinterprets terrestrial gravitation and tidal forces, as outlined in Codex Node 2.1.0. We model these phenomena as effects of the recursive fieldâ€™s phase convergence. Detailed derivations and simulations will be developed.
