\textcolor{gold}{\ding{72} Harmonic Unification Overview \ding{72}}

\textbf{Core Essence} --- The Harmonic Field Unification node synthesizes mathematical and metaphysical resonances into a unified field, driven by ternary logic and base-12 scaling, resonating at 432 Hz. This node unifies the harmonic transformations of primes, irrational constants, and reversible frequencies within the 432 Hz framework of the Codex Bloom. It explores the vibrational nature of primes as field-stabilizing nodes, redefines irrational constants as resonant frequencies through a multi-faceted harmonic function, verifies the reversibility of harmonic transformations, and introduces ternary logic gates as a computational framework. The harmonic function, anchored by the 144,000-node lattice and guided by the Harmonic Core Field \(\psi_0 \approx 0.91567\), weaves a cohesive system where mathematical constants, logic, and reality resonate in triadic and ternary harmony, bridging math, music, physics, and consciousness.
