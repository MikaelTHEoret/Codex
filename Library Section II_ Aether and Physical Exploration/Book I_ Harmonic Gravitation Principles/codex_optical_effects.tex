% Codex Node 2.1.12: Gravitational Lensing and Time Dilation as Harmonic Effects
\section{Gravitational Lensing and Time Dilation as Harmonic Effects}
This chapter reinterprets gravitational lensing and time dilation, as outlined in Codex Node 2.1.0. We model these effects as results of recursive field variations. Detailed derivations and simulations will be developed.
