% Codex Node 2.1.7: Harmonic Gravitational Waves and Discrepancies
\section{Harmonic Gravitational Waves and Discrepancies}
This chapter addresses gravitational wave discrepancies and reinterprets gravitational waves, as outlined in Codex Node 2.1.0. We model waves as recursive field perturbations, matching observed discrepancies. Detailed derivations and simulations will be provided.
