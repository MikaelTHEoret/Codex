% Codex Node 2.1.3: Cosmic Expansion and Dark Energy Resolution
\section{Cosmic Expansion and Dark Energy Resolution}
This chapter addresses the dark energy problem and cosmic expansion, as outlined in Codex Node 2.1.0. We reinterpret expansion as an outward phase expansion of the recursive field, eliminating the need for dark energy. Detailed derivations and cosmological models will be developed to support this resolution.
