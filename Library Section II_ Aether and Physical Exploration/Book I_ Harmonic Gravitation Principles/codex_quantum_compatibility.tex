% Codex Node 2.1.1: Resolving Quantum Incompatibility with Harmonic Gravitation
\section{Resolving Quantum Incompatibility with Harmonic Gravitation}
This chapter addresses the incompatibility between classical gravity and quantum mechanics, as outlined in Codex Node 2.1.0. We provide a detailed harmonic resolution, showing how the recursive fieldâ€™s wave-based nature integrates quantum fluctuations, avoiding singularities at the Planck scale. Detailed derivations and potential simulations will be developed to support this resolution.
