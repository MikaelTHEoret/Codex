% Codex Node 2.1.5: Mass-Independent Gravitation and the Hierarchy Problem
\section{Mass-Independent Gravitation and the Hierarchy Problem}
This chapter addresses the mass-dependent nature of classical gravity and the hierarchy problem, as outlined in Codex Node 2.1.0. We demonstrate how the harmonic model decouples gravity from mass, resolving the hierarchy issue. Detailed derivations will be provided.
