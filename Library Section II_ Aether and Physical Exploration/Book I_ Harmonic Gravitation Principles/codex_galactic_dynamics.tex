% Codex Node 2.1.2: Galactic Dynamics and Dark Matter Resolution
\section{Galactic Dynamics and Dark Matter Resolution}
This chapter resolves the dark matter problem in galactic rotation curves, as outlined in Codex Node 2.1.0. Using the toroidal framework, we demonstrate how logarithmic spirals induced by phase convergence match observed rotation curves without dark matter. Detailed derivations and simulations will be provided to validate this approach.
