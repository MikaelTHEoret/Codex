% Codex Node 2.1.8: A Fundamental Mechanism for Gravity: Harmonic Memory Paths
\section{A Fundamental Mechanism for Gravity: Harmonic Memory Paths}
This chapter provides a fundamental mechanism for gravity, as outlined in Codex Node 2.1.0. We define gravity as a memory path in the recursive field, driven by phase compression. Detailed derivations will be developed to support this mechanism.
