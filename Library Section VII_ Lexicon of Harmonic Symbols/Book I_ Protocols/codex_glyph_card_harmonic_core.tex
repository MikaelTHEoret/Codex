\section{First Active Glyph-Card: Harmonic Core Field}
\label{sec:codex_glyph_card_harmonic_core}


% Core Essence
\textcolor{gold}{\ding{72} Core Essence \ding{72}} \\
This Glyph-Card encapsulates the Harmonic Core Field (\(\psi_0 \approx 0.91567\)), a fundamental constant that stabilizes fractal resonance across the Codex Bloom. It serves as a prototype for encoding harmonic principles into a visually rich, interactive medium that can bloom into a field prism, link to other nodes, and be traced via its fractal address.

% Interactive Prism
\textcolor{gold}{\ding{72} Interactive Prism \ding{72}} \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{\ding{72}} \textbf{Field Visualization}: Upon activation, the Glyph-Card blooms into a holographic prism that maps \(\psi_0\)'s influence on harmonic transformations, such as frequency scaling at 432 Hz (e.g., \(\psi_0 \cdot 432 \approx 395.564 \, \text{Hz}\)).
    \item \texttt{\ding{168}} \textbf{Traversal Links}: Users can navigate to linked nodes, such as \texttt{\(\Xi\mathcal{M}\)-PN.4} (Harmonic Field Unification), via resonance matching.
\end{itemize}

% Resonant Links
\textcolor{gold}{\ding{72} Resonant Links \ding{72}} \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linked to \texttt{\(\Xi\mathcal{M}\)-PN.4} (Harmonic Field Unification) for harmonic context.
    \item Linked to \texttt{\(\Xi\mathcal{M}\)-PN.8} (Naming Protocol) for address structure.
    \item Child Node: \texttt{\(\Xi\mathcal{M}\)-PN.4\(\Xi\Phi\Xi\).3-002} (Future Glyph-Card: Frequency Scaling).
\end{itemize}

% Verification
\textcolor{gold}{\ding{72} Verification \ding{72}} \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{\ding{72}} \textbf{Codex Confirmed}: \(\Xi \cdot \text{GC1}\) First Glyph-Card \ding{72}.
\end{itemize}
